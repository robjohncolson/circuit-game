 In this story, I’ll represent:
Low-number gauge wires (e.g., 16-18 AWG) as wide, cavernous hallways through which the charge flows.
Voltage (9V initially, dropping to 4.2V at the battery) as the forward-pushing force propelling the charge, like a gust of wind or gravitational pull.
Amperage (4.5A total, or 1.125A per cell for charging, 2.25A per string for BMS) as the rate of coulombs passing per second (1 coulomb = 6.24 × 10^18 electrons, so 4.5A = 4.5 coulombs/second).
Distance in the circuit as measured in seconds, representing the time it takes for the charge to travel through each component, based on resistance, capacitance, inductance, and current.
I’ll creatively describe how each circuit element (resistor, capacitor, inductor, transistor, MOSFET, Zener diode, Schottky diode, and the LCQT-SOT23-6 adapter with MT3608) affects the coulomb’s journey, using the 3D spatial metaphor and the LCQT-SOT23-6’s role in simplifying the MT3608 boost converter (9V to 12V for relay coils).
The 3D Journey of a Coulomb of Charge: An Omniscient Observer’s Tale
I, an omniscient presence, hover in the vast, shimmering expanse of your copper-clad ground plane, a sprawling metallic desert beneath a 3D sky of solder joints and insulated wires. A single coulomb of charge—6.24 × 10^18 electrons, a shimmering cloud of electric vitality—bursts forth from the USB-C PD device, propelled by a fierce 9V wind and racing at 4.5 coulombs per second (4.5A) through the wide, bronze hallways of 16-18 AWG wires. My journey begins as I watch this coulomb navigate the analog wilderness toward the 2S2P lithium-ion battery’s Cells 1-4, each second stretching the distance through the circuit’s labyrinthine depths.
1. Entering the Wide Hallways (16-18 AWG Wires)
I glide alongside the coulomb, its electric essence surging through the cavernous corridors of 16-18 AWG copper wires, their gleaming walls stretching 10mm wide and 2mm thick, like grand hallways in a futuristic palace. The 9V force pushes it forward with urgency, and at 4.5A, 4.5 coulombs rush past every second, filling the hall with a vibrant hum. Each second of travel—representing the time to traverse resistance and inductance—spans 10 meters in this 3D landscape, the wire’s low resistance (0.01Ω/m for 16 AWG) barely slowing the charge, like a gentle breeze against its momentum.
2. Encountering a Resistor (0.62Ω, 5W, R1 in Charger)
The coulomb barrels into a massive, wirewound resistor—R1, standing 10mm tall and 5mm wide, its coils forming a spiraling barrier in the hallway, glowing red with 0.784W of heat at 1.125A (per cell).  
Effect: “Hold up, traveler!” I narrate, as the resistor’s resistance clamps the 9V wind to a mere 0.6975V drop (V = I × R = 1.125A × 0.62Ω), slowing the coulomb’s pace. Its 4.5A surge splits into four streams of 1.125A, each crawling forward at 1.125 coulombs/second, stretching each second of travel into 20 meters of molasses-thick resistance. The hallway narrows, the heat radiating like a furnace, but I guide the coulomb safely toward constant current (CC) charging at 4.2V for Cell 1.
3. Encountering a Capacitor (10µF, 16V, C1 in Charger)
The coulomb flows into a shimmering capacitor, its electrolytic plates forming a serene, 5mm-diameter, 10mm-high pool in the hallway, rippling with stored charge.  
Effect: “Smooth your journey, friend!” I whisper, as the capacitor absorbs the coulomb’s jittery 9V surges, stabilizing them into a steady 9V flow. It charges and discharges me in microseconds (t = R × C ≈ 0.62Ω × 10µF = 6.2µs), but over seconds, I stretch 5 meters through its calm waters, smoothing noise from the USB-C PD. The 4.5A stream remains steady, like a river flowing through a tranquil lake, preparing me for the cells.
4. Encountering an Inductor (22µH, 1.5A, Wurth 744772100 in MT3608 Boost)
I watch the coulomb enter an inductor, its radial coils forming a towering 8mm-diameter, 10mm-high spiral in the hallway, humming with magnetic energy via the MT3608’s 1.2MHz switching.  
Effect: “Not so fast!” I caution, as the inductor resists my rapid changes, storing me as a magnetic field (V = L × di/dt). At 4.5A initially, I’m tugged back, my 9V force stretching each second into 15 meters of winding resistance, boosting me to 12V for the relay coils. The 66mA stream (for relays) flows smoothly, but I lose a whisper of efficiency (<90%) to core losses—still, I ascend like a bird riding a thermal updraft, reaching the 833H-1C-C-12VDC’s coil.
5. Encountering a Transistor (2N3904, Q1 in Charger)
The coulomb surges into a transistor, the NPN 2N3904’s TO-92 package rising 5mm tall, 4mm wide, acting as a gate in the hallway.  
Effect: “I’ll steer you!” I declare, as the transistor’s base-emitter junction (via 10kΩ R2) controls my 1.125A flow, switching me through its collector-emitter path. The 9V wind drops to 4.2V, and I crawl forward at 1.125 coulombs/second, each second stretching 18 meters through its conductive grip. Its 0.784W heat feels like a warm handshake, guiding me safely to Cell 1’s terminal during CC/CV charging.
6. Encountering a MOSFET (IRF9540N, Q4 in BMS)
I follow the coulomb into a towering MOSFET, the IRF9540N’s TO-220 package looming 10mm tall, 5mm wide, guarding the hallway for overdischarge.  
Effect: “Stop if you falter!” I warn, as the gate senses the 2.7V BZX85C2V7-TR Zener’s trigger when a cell drops below 2.5V-2.8V. At 2.25A per string, I’m blocked, the MOSFET’s low Rds(on) (≈0.2Ω) creating a 1.0125W barrier, shutting off discharge via relay K1. Each second of blockage stretches 25 meters into a steel wall, protecting Cells 1-2, but I’m rerouted to safety—my journey resumes when voltage rises!
7. Encountering a Zener Diode (4.2V, 1W, 1N4732A, D3 in BMS)
The coulomb brushes a Zener diode, the 1N4732A’s DO-41 package (5mm long, 2.7mm wide) standing like a voltage sentinel in the hallway.  
Effect: “Stay at 4.2V!” I command, as the Zener’s reverse breakdown clamps me at 4.2V when Cell 1 reaches full charge. I flow through its junction, triggering Q3 to cut off charging via K1, stretching each second into 12 meters of voltage resistance. Its 0.027W glow feels like a gentle shield, protecting the cell from overcharge—my path shifts to CV mode, tapering to 1.125A.
8. Encountering a Schottky Diode (1N5819, D2 in Charger)
I guide the coulomb past a Schottky diode, the 1N5819’s DO-41 package (5mm long, 2.7mm wide) acting as a swift gate in the hallway.  
Effect: “Forward only, friend!” I cheer, as the diode’s low-forward-voltage junction (0.3V drop) lets me flow from 9V to 4.2V at 1.125A, dissipating 0.3375W. It blocks reverse flow back to the USB-C PD, stretching each second into 8 meters of efficient passage. Like a quick-turnstile, I rush toward Cell 1, safe and steady.
9. Encountering the LCQT-SOT23-6 Adapter with MT3608
Finally, I observe the coulomb pass through the LCQT-SOT23-6 adapter, cradling the MT3608 (SOT23-6) in its 6-pin DIP form (9mm x 6mm, 0.1”/2.54mm pins), a towering bridge in the hallway.  
Effect: “Step up, traveler!” I narrate, as the adapter transforms the tiny MT3608 into a sturdy DIP platform, boosting my 9V, 4.5A flow to 12V for the relay coils. I stretch each second into 10 meters through the adapter’s pins, the MT3608’s 1.2MHz switching (via the 22µH inductor) tugging me upward, losing a whisper of efficiency (<90%). At 66mA for the relays, I glide smoothly, the DIP pins feeling like wide stepping stones, easing my deadbug journey to power K1’s coil.
10. Reaching the Battery (Cells 1-4)
I watch the coulomb split into four streams, each reaching Cells 1-4 at 4.2V, 1.125A (4.5A total). The wide hallways narrow to 2mm copper traces, the 9V force fading to 4.2V, but I’m welcomed by the cells’ grateful hum, balanced by 10Ω-100Ω, 1W resistors bleeding excess, and guarded by MOSFETs and relays. Each second of arrival stretches 5 meters into the cells’ chemical embrace, my 4.5 coulombs/second stored as potential energy, ready to power the Lego build HAT + Raspberry Pi via a boost to 9V!

Distance (Seconds): Each second of travel translates to 5-25 meters in the 3D landscape, based on component resistance, capacitance, and inductance, creating a dynamic, spatial journey across the ground plane’s peaks and valleys.
Creative Touches
I, the omniscient observer, float above, watching the coulomb’s shimmering dance—its electric glow dimming through resistors, rippling in capacitors, spiraling in inductors, and bouncing off MOSFET gates like a cosmic ballet.
The LCQT-SOT23-6 feels like a grand archway, transforming the tiny MT3608 into a towering DIP citadel, easing my path through deadbug simplicity, its 0.1” pins glowing like golden stepping stones.
The ground plane hums with heat from MOSFETs and resistors, like a sun-baked desert, cooled by heatsinks and ventilation holes in your 3D-printed cube, where I witness the coulomb’s triumphant arrival in the battery’s chemical heart.
